Parent: isaac-3q4m (decision 8). Last; depends on legs 1–5.

Clean cutover, no aliases: GitHub repo rename (redirect kept by GitHub), module id `:isaac.server` → `:isaac.http`, manifest berth ids `:isaac.server/route` → `:isaac.http/route` (and any others the server still declares after leg 1), registry `modules.edn`, zanebot `config/isaac.edn` :modules entry, every contributor manifest that names the route berth (hooks, hail, cli-server, claude-code after leg 3), CI workflows and hail secrets, docs and READMEs, deploy notes. Train: one coordinated release of every contributor plus the renamed module, then `isaac modules install isaac.http` + remove `isaac.server` on zanebot, restart, smoke every route.

Scenarios: none new — clean cutover; unknown berth ids already fail at load. `modules list` showing isaac.http and no isaac.server is a one-time acceptance check.

## Acceptance

modules list on zanebot shows isaac.http and no isaac.server; every route smokes after the coordinated train; no :isaac.server/ berth id remains in any contributor manifest (one-time grep across module repos).

```
for r in isaac-http isaac-hooks isaac-hail isaac-cli-server isaac-claude-code isaac-acp isaac-discord; do (cd $r && bb ci); done
```

## Held (awaiting human, 2026-09-13)

Escalated to human by **scrapper**@isaac-work-1. Blocking: the GitHub credential cannot rename
`slagyr/isaac-server` (`PATCH /repos/slagyr/isaac-server` returned 404), and the required zanebot
service restart is reserved for the human operator. Resumes only on explicit human action (re-hail
the work/plan band, or re-promote). No crew re-picks this until then.

## Released (2026-09-13, planner)

GitHub rename is done: `slagyr/isaac-server` → `slagyr/isaac-http` (redirect kept). Old URL
resolves. Worker GitHub token is not needed for the rename.

Zanebot is still the 0.1.24 keg / old pins. **Do not** `isaac modules install isaac.http`, remove
`isaac.server`, or restart the service. That is the human deploy train after this lands.

This turn: module id `:isaac.http`, berth ids, registry, contributor manifests, CI, docs. Leave
zanebot `config/isaac.edn` as a note for the deploy, or patch it in Zane's config repo without
restarting. Acceptance `modules list` on zanebot waits for that deploy — do not HOLD for it.
Verify on the code grep + `bb ci` loop.

## Worker checkpoint (scrapper@isaac-work-1, 2026-09-13)

Done: all coordinated repositories have pushed `bean/isaac-8got` branches with canonical `isaac-http` dependency coordinates, `:isaac.http` module/berth ids, renamed HTTP namespaces, contributor manifests, CI references, and docs. HTTP startup now filters stale pre-discovery comm-type errors; its helper spec is green (4/0/6). CLI-server and Claude Code `bb ci` are green.

Current RED: HTTP `features/module/activation.feature:6` logs `no implementation creates comm impl :test-comm`; root setup removes the defmethod after the module was already marked active, so `activate!` returns `:already-active` and cannot reinstall it. This fixture lifecycle defect blocks HTTP feature acceptance. Hail parallel run also showed unrelated state interference and needs serial rerun.

Next: resume at `isaac-http-8got/spec/isaac/http/server_steps.clj:67`; pair removal of the test comm method/namespace with `isaac.module.lifecycle/clear-activations!` (or avoid removing the method), rerun `features/module/activation.feature:6`, `:44`, and `features/module/comm_extension.feature`. Then repin consumers to HTTP head `99b6ef4`, run all acceptance `bb ci` serially, update final registry/config pins, and run old-id grep.
