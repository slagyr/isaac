Parent: isaac-3q4m (decision 8). Last; depends on legs 1–5.

Clean cutover, no aliases: GitHub repo rename (redirect kept by GitHub), module id `:isaac.server` → `:isaac.http`, manifest berth ids `:isaac.server/route` → `:isaac.http/route` (and any others the server still declares after leg 1), registry `modules.edn`, zanebot `config/isaac.edn` :modules entry, every contributor manifest that names the route berth (hooks, hail, cli-server, claude-code after leg 3), CI workflows and hail secrets, docs and READMEs, deploy notes. Train: one coordinated release of every contributor plus the renamed module, then `isaac modules install isaac.http` + remove `isaac.server` on zanebot, restart, smoke every route.

Scenarios: none new — clean cutover; unknown berth ids already fail at load. `modules list` showing isaac.http and no isaac.server is a one-time acceptance check.

## Acceptance

modules list on zanebot shows isaac.http and no isaac.server; every route smokes after the coordinated train; no :isaac.server/ berth id remains in any contributor manifest (one-time grep across module repos).

```
for r in isaac-http isaac-hooks isaac-hail isaac-cli-server isaac-claude-code isaac-acp isaac-discord; do (cd $r && bb ci); done
```

## Held (awaiting human, 2026-09-13)

Escalated to human by **scrapper**@isaac-work-1. Blocking: the GitHub credential cannot rename
`slagyr/isaac-server` (`PATCH /repos/slagyr/isaac-server` returned 404), and the required zanebot
service restart is reserved for the human operator. Resumes only on explicit human action (re-hail
the work/plan band, or re-promote). No crew re-picks this until then.

## Released (2026-09-13, planner)

GitHub rename is done: `slagyr/isaac-server` → `slagyr/isaac-http` (redirect kept). Old URL
resolves. Worker GitHub token is not needed for the rename.

Zanebot is still the 0.1.24 keg / old pins. **Do not** `isaac modules install isaac.http`, remove
`isaac.server`, or restart the service. That is the human deploy train after this lands.

This turn: module id `:isaac.http`, berth ids, registry, contributor manifests, CI, docs. Leave
zanebot `config/isaac.edn` as a note for the deploy, or patch it in Zane's config repo without
restarting. Acceptance `modules list` on zanebot waits for that deploy — do not HOLD for it.
Verify on the code grep + `bb ci` loop.

## Worker checkpoint (scrapper@isaac-work-1, 2026-09-13)

Done: pushed coordinated `bean/isaac-8got` branches for HTTP, Foundation, Agent, hooks, hail, cli-server, claude-code, ACP, Discord, iMessage, cron, episodes, cli-proxy, MCP, worksite, foreman, root registry, and zane config. HTTP `bb ci` is green (121/0/249 specs; 46/0/96 features). Hooks specs are green and its product/feature classpath now uses Foundation/Agent/HTTP rename-train commits.

Current RED: hooks full `bb ci` reaches the feature suite but cannot resolve `isaac.tool.names` from the Agent spec support until every Agent coordinate in hooks is pinned to the train head; hail focused/full features separately show config entity loading failures that likely have the same mixed-pin cause.

Next: resume at `isaac-hooks-8got/deps.edn:7`; audit every Agent SHA in deps.edn/bb.edn with `grep -n isaac-agent`, pin all to `8aecfc3a57fef0803c35f81bd4a3f76292b227f1`, rerun hooks `bb ci`, then repeat pin audit/CI for hail and the remaining five acceptance repos. Finally update registry/config to final SHAs and run cross-repo old-id grep.
